##example of how I structure my queries files (mlb_queries.py, nba_queries.py, etc.)
#each query is structured like this: (link to the sportsdatabase website of that query, text of the query, play for that query (On, Against, Over, Under, etc.))
queries = [
    ('https://sportsdatabase.com/mlb/query?output=default&su=1&ou=1&sdql=H&submit=++S+D+Q+L+%21++', 'H', 'On')
]
